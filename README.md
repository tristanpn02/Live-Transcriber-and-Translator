A python script that transcribes and translates audio live from the **default microphone**.

This can be used in discord calls for example to know what others are saying in another language if used with [VB Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) for example.

First install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`, make sure you select the correct microphone as default on your device and then run the script with `py main.py`.
